My name is Krishnan Srinivasarengan. I'm a control engineer by training and spirit. I enjoy solving problems using tools from applied mathematics, including machine learning, signal processing, control theory to solve problems in engineering and cyber-physical systems. I have a PhD in Automatic Control from Universit√© de Lorraine, Nancy, France (Research Centre for Automatic Control, a CNRS lab).
